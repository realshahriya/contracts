One additional note from our side regarding development standards:

All smart contracts must be:
Fully Testable and Auditable
Covered by 100% test cases for all critical functions
Deployed and verified on Base Sepolia before mainnet launch
Delivered with detailed README, test scripts, and deployment flows

Flexible for Future Changes
Please ensure that the architecture is future-proof and modular, allowing us to:
Add new logic (e.g., alternative vesting models, dynamic treasury logic)
Adjust parameters via multisig governance
Upgrade core functions without redeploying contracts
We understand that UUPS proxy is recommended â€” but can you confirm whether this is fully compatible and stable on Base L2, including:
Proxy pattern integrity
Upgrade workflows

Deployment via popular frameworks like Hardhat/Foundry on Base?

The long-term goal is to maintain agility for future product iterations without disrupting the deployed ecosystem.
Clarification on start_timestamp in the Vesting Contract
Yes, the start_timestamp parameter should define the point in time when the vesting schedule begins for each beneficiary. The contract must support:

Multiple independent vesting schedules with customizable parameters:
cliff
slicePeriod
duration
% unlock at cliff
Efficient batch-adding of beneficiaries (via Merkle proof or similar mechanism)
On-chain claiming of unlocked tokens by beneficiaries
This vesting mechanism will be used primarily for distributing allocations to team members, advisors, KOLs, and selected community participants in compliance with our tokenomics.

Liquidity Contract â€“ Treasury Purpose
This contract is intended as a non-custodial treasury module, not as a traditional DEX LP contract. Its key purposes:
Holding project-controlled reserves of $HYPEY and (optionally) stablecoins
Enabling allocation/disbursement of tokens to designated wallets:
Liquidity provisioning (e.g., via multisig-controlled wallet)
Launchpad allocations
Marketing/Community/Partnership funds
Governance via multisig (Ownable)

Upgradable via UUPS Proxy
ðŸ”’ Note: The contract will not interact directly with DEX routers, nor expose any public-facing liquidity functions.

DEX Integration
Although this contract wonâ€™t directly interface with DEXs (like Uniswap or BaseSwap), we plan to deploy liquidity on public pools (e.g., $HYPEY/USDC) via multisig wallet actions. Therefore:
No swap logic is needed
No dependency on specific router contracts

However, the treasury contract must allow token disbursement for LP provisioning
Â Â  -Suggestions for Additional Best Practices
To streamline development and ensure audit-readiness, please consider:
Role-based access control: Distinct roles for vesting manager vs. treasury manager (e.g., via OpenZeppelin's AccessControl)
Pausable logic: Optional pause mechanism to temporarily stop vesting claims or treasury disbursements in case of emergency
Events: Emit structured events for each disbursement, vesting creation, and claim to support analytics and audit trails
Pre-deployment testing: Use Foundry or Hardhat to achieve 100% coverage on all core contract logic
Compliance: Ensure contracts are aligned with MiCA Article 69, including data persistence and update governance (multi-sig upgrades)

As part of the HYPEY project, we would like to commission the preparation of three basic smart contracts that we will launch on the Base L2 network . Below we send you a concise specification and ask for an indicative quote (cost + time) for the implementation of step I. We will commission the subsequent modules (Challenge Crowdfunding, Staking) in the next step - for now we do not include them in the calculation.

The HYPEY ecosystem requires a series of smart contracts to support its tokenized economy, ensuring full decentralization, compliance with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), and transparent, automated fund distribution mechanisms.
The key components include:
The HYPEY Token Smart Contract â€“ A utility token deployed on Base or Polygon L2, featuring vesting mechanisms, token burning, and liquidity allocation.
The Challenge Crowdfunding Smart Contract â€“ A decentralized contract that holds user deposits for challenges and automatically distributes rewards or refunds based on the challenge outcome.
(Future) Staking Smart Contract (subject to legal viability under MiCA) â€“ A staking mechanism fueled by the Proof of Livestream system, ensuring sustainable rewards for token holders.
The fundamental principle behind these contracts is that HYPEY, as a platform, will never have access to or control over usersâ€™ funds, aligning with both decentralization ideals and MiCA compliance requirements.
1. HYPEY Token Smart Contract
Blockchain & Technical Considerations
The token will be deployed on Base or Polygon L2 to ensure scalability, lower gas fees, and compatibility with future enhancements.
It will follow an L2-compatible token standard rather than ERC-20 to maximize efficiency.
Core Token Functionalities
Vesting & Cliff Mechanisms: Tokens allocated for different purposes (Private Sale, Team, Marketing, Development, etc.) will have structured vesting schedules to prevent market manipulation.
Burning Mechanism: A portion of the transaction fees or specific interactions can trigger token burning to regulate supply.
Liquidity & Launchpad Allocation: Reserves will be allocated to ensure healthy liquidity and ecosystem growth.
Utility Features
Proof of Livestream: Tokens are generated and added to the staking reward pool based on livestream engagement metrics.
Community Voting: Token holders will be able to participate in governance decisions, such as selecting new platform features or sponsored challenges.
Virtual Item Trading: Users can spend tokens on digital goods within the HYPEY ecosystem, such as exclusive skins, boosters, or event access.
Auto Swap: A seamless conversion mechanism between Hypey Gems (used by non-crypto users) and the $HYPEY token.
Regulatory Compliance & Security
No Custodial Control: HYPEY cannot store or control users' tokens at any point.
On-Chain Transparency: All transactions will be auditable, ensuring compliance with regulatory scrutiny.
Anti-Fraud & AML Protections: Preventative measures will be implemented to deter illicit activity.
2. Challenge Crowdfunding Smart Contract
Purpose & Decentralization
The contract serves as a fully autonomous escrow system for challenge-based crowdfunding.Once users deposit tokens into a challenge pool, the smart contract independently holds and processes funds based on the challenge's success criteria.
How It Works
Users deposit tokens into the contract to back a specific challenge.The contract holds funds in a non-custodial manner (HYPEY does not have access).
If the challenge is completed successfully:
The reward is automatically transferred to the challenge creator.
A small fee (predefined percentage) is allocated to HYPEY.
If the challenge is not completed or fails:
All funds are refunded to the original backers.
HYPEY does not receive any payment.
Key Features
Trustless Fund Management: The contract guarantees that funds cannot be misused or withdrawn by any unauthorized entity.
Success-Based Fee Collection: HYPEY only earns from challenges that are successfully completed, ensuring fairness.
Decentralized Success Verification: The contract will support oracle integration or community-based validation to determine challenge outcomes.
Dispute Resolution Mechanism: If a dispute arises, the contract can integrate with a DAO arbitration system or an on-chain validation mechanism.
Regulatory Compliance
Funds remain under smart contract control, not HYPEYâ€™s.
Full refund mechanism protects contributors from financial risk.

Ensures a transparent, automated process in line with MiCA standards.
3. (Future) Staking Smart Contract (Pending legal review under MiCA)
Concept
The staking contract will be fueled by Proof of Livestream rewards, allowing token holders to stake their $HYPEY tokens in exchange for passive income.
A predefined staking pool will be allocated to ensure sustainability.
Key Functionalities
Dynamic Rewards: Adjusted based on staking participation and available reward pools.
Withdrawal Safeguards: Prevents excessive liquidity drains through withdrawal limits.
Flexible Lock-up Periods: Users can opt for different staking durations with corresponding reward multipliers.
Security & Compliance
Non-Custodial Staking: Users retain control over their tokens at all times.
Sustainable Model: Rewards are funded in part by platform engagement, ensuring long-term viability.
Anti-Manipulation Measures: Prevents large-scale abuse of the staking system.
